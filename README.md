# Recap Project
This project implements a password validation system. The password must meet the following conditions:

- Contain at least one digit

- Contain at least one special character

- Contain at least one uppercase letter

- Contain at least one lowercase letter

- Be at least 8 characters long

# Process (TTD)
I started by writing test cases to define the conditions for a valid password, then proceeded to implement the corresponding function. Additionally, I added a "Generate Random Secure Password" feature, which ensures that the generated password always passes all the conditions outlined above.

# Tools used:
Java: The primary programming language used for implementing the function and tests.

JUnit: A testing framework for validating the correctness of the password validation function.

Maven (CI/CD): Used for managing dependencies and continuous integration/deployment.
